	<p>Hi alex,<br>This is a new idea I had and it was to develop a website that just you and me could acces with a password that only WE know. First i was making this website to write you a paragraph for our two months but then I had much more ideas and this is what i finally got. The idea of this website is that every month or every week, we add some photos here so we remember what happened during this month, and we see some photos, and I did it because i think it was cute. Down there you will see our 2nd month highlights, i hope you like this idea, every month the password will be changed, every month we will add new highlights, so that in like one year (I hope we stay toghether for a very long time :-) and sorry if im saying this) we see all those photos ansd remember our times toghether. Anyways i hope you like this idea, and I wanted to tell you that this month was like the best month in my entire life; I never felt that loved, i never felt that someone cares for me, and now it is happening, and i know it is the best feeling in the world, to feel loved by the person you love the most. Thanks for all those moments you made my heart go grazy, thanks for all those moment you made me feel loved. I swear i never thought we could be toghether and you don't know how happy i am to be with you, every little thing that you make for me makes me happy, every little moment that i spend with you makes me feel loved.THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. I love you.

		Mabrouk to our two months.

		Oh, and dont forget to check the website each 2 weeks, it will be updated and renovated just for YOU (if you like this idea).<br>It can feature periods papers, monthly highlights, and much more surprises :-)<br> JE T'ADORES
