  <p> Hi alex,<br>I don't know when you are checking this website, but i renovated it just for you, so you can enjoy seeing our pictures toghether online. You are probably reading this after christmas, or on the 24th, and we are also probably not seeing each other again before your trip, or before the new year 2020, and i just wanted to add if i didnt say it enough, that i will miss you very very very very much, that it will be very very very hard to live without you for one week. Last time you went to athenes for 4 days and i felt heart broken, i dont know how i will survive this time without wifi, without any sign of your presence all day long, i really don't know how i will do. Anyways i hope you had or that you will have a very good christmas evening with your family, and i wanted to wish you a merry christmas, for you and for your family, i and wanted to say that i love you so much, i know i always say that, but it very important for me, so i say it every single time im with you in every paragraph. I don't know what to say here, the letter that i wrote you sad it all. I am still remembering this movie we watched toghether and i want you to know that it was the best movie in my life,the best night in my life, every night with you becomes one of the best nights in my life, and thanks for being in my life life and for making each night with you unforgettable :) . <br><br>Anyways i hope you liked the gifts, sorry if they were a little weird or dumb, but i hope you appreciated them, and I Love You, I Love You so much words can't describe it, I Love You Hayete <3 <3<br><br>AND MERRY CHRISTMAS
